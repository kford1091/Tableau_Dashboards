## Project Overview

Brief description of your analysis and findings

The Superstore's returned orders were analyzed to help the CEO understand what is causing customers to return orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.  There are 3 different ways of measuring returns: return rate, total cost of returns, and total number of returns.  Return rate was the best measurement in this case because it measured behavioral insights.  Also, key areas such as product categories, geographical regions, and time periods contributed to the high return rates.  After analyzing the return rates and these key areas, some root causes were identified such as product quality issues, size/specification mismatch, and seasonal factors.  Finally, addressing these root identified causes will reduce the return rate thus improving customer satisfaction.      



## Key Insights

- Summary of your return analysis findings

Measuring returns can be measured 3 different ways: return rate, total cost of returns, or the total number of returns. Which measure is better and when one is better than the other depends on the scenario.  Return rate is better utilized when measuring behavioral insights.  Total cost of return is better when measuring financial impacts and total number of returns is best utilized when measuring logistics and inventory returns.    
  
- Root causes identified

The root causes identified are: 
    - product quality issues 
    - size/specification mismatch 
    - incorrect orders 
    - customer expectations
    - seasonal factors
    - geographic trends.

These causes are behavioral and the best measurement to utilize is the return rate.

The components on the dashboard are: 

1) Return Rate by Product bar chart: displays the return rate by product category and identifies which categories have the highest proportion of returned products. 
     
2) Return Rate by State map: shows return rates by state and reveals that Utah at 57%, California and Oregon both at 45% show the three highest return rates.

3) Return Rate by Month line chart: seasonal analysis revealing August is the highest rate of returns with 39% while November is the lowest with 17%.
 
4) Return Rate Category/Sales Composite chart: analysis of product categories and sales reveals technology leads in both sales and return rates, showing potential quality issues despite strong market demand.  Furniture and office have similar return rates, but higher sales volume suggests different underlying factors driving returns.

The dashboard should be interpreted as using the what-where-why approach.  What metric, time period, and main story am I looking at?  Where numbers, trends, and filters do I see?  Why do these patterns exist?  

The utilization of filters to identify root causes should start broad, then narrow.  Second, the filters should be in layer by combining them to drill deeper.  Finally, the utilization of filters is to prove or disprove your theories.

After identifying root causes with the dashboard these actions should be taken to reduce the high rate of returns.           

1) Product/Quality Improvements
2) Customer Experience Enhancements
3) Process Changes
4) Targeted Interventions

Monitoring the dashboard will allow identification of these root causes in order to address these causes in a efficient and timely manner.

- Recommendations

The recommended action to address the root causes of the high rate of returns is to address product defects by working with suppliers to improve quality.  Also, addressing size/specification by enhancing product descriptions and images by updating product listings.  Finally, addressing seasonal factors by adjusting inventory based on regional trends or seasonal patterns through targeted marketing.
